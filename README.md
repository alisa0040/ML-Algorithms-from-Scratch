# ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch
A collection of machine learning algorithms implemented without external libraries, focusing on fundamental concepts.  
These implementations were created as part of my university coursework and personal learning.  

## Implemented Algorithms  
-  Gradient Descent for Linear Regression  
-  Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression  
-  K-Means Clustering for Image Compression

-  ## Repository Structure  
Each algorithm has its own directory with:  
ðŸ“‚ **Notebook (.ipynb)** â€“ Full implementation and explanation.  
ðŸ“‚ **Python Script (.py)** â€“ Clean version of the algorithm.  
ðŸ“‚ **Example Data** â€“ If needed for testing.
